== Donate

Thank you for taking the interest to donate!

Donations can be used to buy a new domain, a server, a new life (for me, lol).

I think most of the money will go towards my personal spending in the beginning.
Funding me would give me more motivation and an alternate source of income, if I somehow get more money than freelancing, I can work on ProxAllium full time and therefore you will benefit indirectly!
Sort of like hiring me to work on ProxAllium.

I have plans to buy a new domain and a new server (VPS) if I get enough monthly donations. I can use the server to run a Tor server so that you guys can have an `.onion` entry point to this website.
