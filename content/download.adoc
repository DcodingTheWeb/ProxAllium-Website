== Download ProxAllium

ProxAllium is made for Windows and it should work with Windows XP and above.

You can download the 32-bit version which should work on all systems (including 64-bit) from these mirrors:

. http://download.tuxfamily.org/proxallium/releases/0.2/ProxAllium-v0.2-alpha_Tor-0.2.9.10.7z[Download from Tux Family]
. https://github.com/DcodingTheWeb/ProxAllium/releases/download/v0.2-alpha/ProxAllium-v0.2-alpha_Tor-0.2.9.10.7z[Download from GitHub]

You should get a `7z` archive with all of the necessary files required to get ProxAllium running. We recommend using http://7-zip.org[7-zip] to extract the archive!
