== Download ProxAllium

ProxAllium is made for Windows and it should work with Windows XP and above.

The latest version of ProxAllium is image:https://img.shields.io/github/release/DcodingTheWeb/ProxAllium/all.svg[{proxallium_version},link="https://github.com/DcodingTheWeb/ProxAllium/releases/tag/{proxallium_version}"].

*Note for previous users*: If you are a previous user of ProxAllium and are updating now, I encourage you to install Tor Browser and use Tor from it as Tor is no longer bundled with ProxAllium (see <<changelog>>). The process is simple and ProxAllium will guide you through most of it, to get started with the Tor update, delete the "Tor" folder before running the updated version.

*Thank you for using ProxAllium!* This will be the final release which is written in AutoIt, I am rewriting a new cross-platform version in C.

However I can hardly take time out for my personal projects as I am busy working as a freelance software developer full time now, please consider link:../donate[donating] to support the development costs and encourage further development.

You can also share ProxAllium with your friends and family, the more the better! My main motivation are my users ðŸ˜„
