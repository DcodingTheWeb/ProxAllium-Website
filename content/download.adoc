*Thank you for using ProxAllium!* This will be the final release which is written in AutoIt, I am planning to re-write it in C and make it cross-platform.

However I can hardly take time out for my personal projects as I am busy working as a freelance software developer full time now, please consider link:../donate[donating] to support the development costs and encourage further development.

You can also share ProxAllium with your friends and family, the more the better! My main motivation are my users ðŸ˜„
