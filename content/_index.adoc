== ProxAllium
ProxAllium is a FOSS (Free and Open Source) GUI wrapper for https://www.torproject.org/[Tor]. I like to call it a "Tor Proxy Bundle" (like the Tor Browser Bundle).

== Getting started
It is easy to get started with ProxAllium, just download it and you are ready to go!

You can also take a look at the link:../doc[documentation], we are in the process of documenting stuff.
